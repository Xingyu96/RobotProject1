For the 2 large projects.

Note: since we will have many people working on different things, make sure that when you make commits to your individual sections, commit them to a branch first, which can be merged online or with bash.

To make a branch:
 git checkout -b [NewBranchName]

To switch branches:
 git checkout [BranchName]
